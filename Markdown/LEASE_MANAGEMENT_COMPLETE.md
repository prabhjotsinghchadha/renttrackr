# Lease Management System - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete lease management system that enables property owners to create leases for tenants, which is a prerequisite for recording rent payments.

## What Was Built

### 1. **LeaseForm Component** (`/src/components/LeaseForm.tsx`)

A comprehensive form for creating tenant leases with:

- Tenant information display
- Lease start and end date pickers
- Monthly rent amount input (auto-filled from unit rent)
- Security deposit input
- Date validation (end date must be after start date)
- Error handling and loading states
- Success/cancel actions

### 2. **New Lease Page** (`/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/dashboard/tenants/[id]/lease/new/page.tsx`)

A dedicated page for creating leases:

- Fetches tenant information
- Retrieves unit rent amount for auto-fill
- Integrates LeaseForm component
- Proper navigation back to tenant detail page

### 3. **Enhanced Tenant Detail Page** (`/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/dashboard/tenants/[id]/page.tsx`)

Updated to display lease information:

- Shows active lease status
- Displays lease details (start date, end date, rent, deposit)
- "Create Lease" button when no active lease exists
- "Record Payment" button when active lease exists
- Conditional quick actions based on lease status

### 4. **LeaseActions.ts - New Function**

Added `getLeasesByTenantId()` function to:

- Fetch all leases for a specific tenant
- Verify user ownership through the property chain
- Return lease data for display

### 5. **Complete Translations**

Added comprehensive translations in 3 languages:

- **English**: Full lease management translations
- **Spanish**: Complete Spanish translations
- **French**: Complete French translations

Translation keys include:

- Form labels and help text
- Error messages
- Page titles and descriptions
- Status indicators
- Action buttons

## Workflow

### Creating a Lease

1. Navigate to a tenant's detail page
2. If no active lease exists, click "Create Lease"
3. Fill in lease details:
   - Start date
   - End date
   - Monthly rent (auto-filled from unit)
   - Security deposit
4. Click "Create Lease"
5. Redirected back to tenant detail page showing active lease

### Recording Payments

Once a lease is created:

1. "Record Payment" button appears in tenant quick actions
2. Click to navigate to payment recording page
3. Select the tenant (lease is automatically linked)
4. Enter payment details
5. Submit to record the payment

## Data Structure

### Lease Model

```typescript
{
  id: uuid
  tenantId: uuid (references tenants)
  startDate: timestamp
  endDate: timestamp
  rent: real
  deposit: real
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

## Features

âœ… Create leases for tenants
âœ… Display active lease information
âœ… Auto-fill rent amount from unit
âœ… Date validation
âœ… Multi-language support
âœ… Proper authorization checks
âœ… Beautiful UI with animations
âœ… Mobile-responsive design
âœ… Error handling
âœ… Loading states

## User Flow

### Complete Workflow from Property to Payment:

1. **Add Property** â†’ Create a rental property
2. **Add Unit** â†’ Add units to the property with rent amounts
3. **Add Tenant** â†’ Assign tenant to a unit
4. **Create Lease** â†’ Set up lease agreement with dates and amounts
5. **Record Payment** â†’ Track rent payments against the lease

## Integration with Payment System

The lease system seamlessly integrates with the payment recording system:

- Payments require an active lease to be recorded
- Tenant detail page shows "Record Payment" only when lease exists
- Payment form filters to show only tenants with active leases
- Lease rent amount is displayed in payment dropdown

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

Future improvements could include:

- Lease renewal functionality
- Lease history view
- Edit existing leases
- Lease expiration reminders
- Automatic late fee calculations based on lease terms
- Digital lease document upload
- Lease templates

## Technical Notes

- All server actions properly verify user ownership
- Dates are handled consistently across timezones
- Currency formatting follows locale standards
- Forms include comprehensive validation
- Empty states guide users through setup process
- Active lease detection checks end date vs current date

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:

- `/src/components/LeaseForm.tsx`
- `/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/dashboard/tenants/[id]/lease/new/page.tsx`

### Modified:

- `/src/actions/LeaseActions.ts` (added `getLeasesByTenantId`)
- `/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/dashboard/tenants/[id]/page.tsx`
- `/src/locales/en.json`
- `/src/locales/es.json`
- `/src/locales/fr.json`

## Summary

The lease management system is fully operational and provides a complete workflow from property setup to payment recording. Users can now:

1. Create leases with proper dates and amounts
2. View active lease information
3. Record payments against leases
4. Track all payment history

This completes the core rental property management workflow! ðŸŽ‰
