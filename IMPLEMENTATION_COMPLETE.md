## üí° Design Decisions Explained

### Why Large Text?

Property owners 50+ may have declining vision. Large text (18-20px) reduces eye strain and improves comprehension.

### Why Emoji Icons?

- No image loading (instant)

- Friendly and approachable
- Accessible to screen readers
- Can be replaced with SVGs later if needed

### Why Card-Based Layout?

- Clear visual groupings
- Easy to scan
- Familiar pattern (seen in many apps)
- Works well on mobile
- Reduces cognitive load

### Why Generous Spacing?

- Reduces visual clutter
- Makes content easier to scan
- Feels more premium
- Improves comprehension
- Less overwhelming for older users
