# Unit Management Implementation - Complete ‚úÖ

## Problem Solved
**Issue:** Users were seeing "no units available" message when trying to add tenants because there was no way to create units in the system.

**Solution:** Implemented complete unit management functionality so users can add units to their properties before adding tenants.

## Implementation Date
October 10, 2025

## Root Cause
The tenant management system requires tenants to be assigned to **units**, not directly to properties. The original implementation was missing the unit management layer, which meant:
- Properties existed ‚úÖ
- Tenants system was ready ‚úÖ  
- **Units were missing** ‚ùå ‚Üê This was the problem

## Files Created

### 1. AddUnitForm Component
**Path:** `src/components/AddUnitForm.tsx`

A client-side form component for adding units to properties.

**Features:**
- Toggle button to show/hide form
- Unit number input (required)
- Rent amount input (required)
- Inline form that appears on property detail page
- Form validation
- Auto-refresh page on success
- Compact design to fit within property detail page

## Files Modified

### 1. PropertyActions.ts
**Path:** `src/actions/PropertyActions.ts`

**Added three new server actions:**

#### `createUnit(data)`
- Creates a new unit for a property
- Validates property ownership
- Parameters: propertyId, unitNumber, rentAmount

#### `updateUnit(unitId, data)`
- Updates an existing unit
- Validates ownership through property chain
- Parameters: unitNumber, rentAmount

#### `deleteUnit(unitId)`
- Deletes a unit (and cascades to tenants)
- Validates ownership before deletion

### 2. Property Detail Page
**Path:** `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/dashboard/properties/[id]/page.tsx`

**Major updates:**
- Now fetches actual property data from database using `getPropertyById()`
- Displays property address and creation date
- Shows list of all units for the property
- Displays unit details (unit number, rent amount)
- Includes AddUnitForm component for adding new units
- Shows warning when no units exist
- Sidebar shows quick stats:
  - Total units count
  - Total monthly rent (sum of all units)
- Each unit has a delete button (placeholder for future)

### 3. Locale Files (en.json, es.json, fr.json)

**Added translations for:**
- Unit management labels
- Form field labels and placeholders
- Validation messages
- Empty states
- Stats labels

## Database Schema

Units table structure (already existed):
```typescript
{
  id: uuid (primary key)
  propertyId: uuid (foreign key to properties.id, cascade on delete)
  unitNumber: varchar(50) (required)
  rentAmount: real (required)
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

## User Flow - How to Add Tenants Now

   - All relationships properly enforced

4. **Security**
   - All operations validate ownership

- **Property Info Card:** Address and unit count
- **Units Section:** 
  - List of all units with number and rent
  - "Add Unit" button/form
  - Delete buttons for each unit

## What's Next

The system is now complete for adding tenants. Users should:

1. **If starting fresh:**
   - Add properties first
   - Add units to each property
   - Then add tenants to units

2. **If already have properties:**
   - Go to each property's detail page
   - Add units using the new form
   - Then proceed to add tenants

## Technical Notes

- Unit numbers are flexible strings (can be "101", "Apt A", "Unit 1", etc.)
- Rent amounts are stored as real numbers (supports decimals)
- Deleting a property cascades to units and tenants
- Deleting a unit cascades to tenants
- All operations are server-side validated

## Responsive Design

All new components are fully responsive:
- Mobile: Stacked layout
- Tablet: Form fields in grid
- Desktop: Full grid layout with sidebar

## Summary

The issue is now resolved. Users were seeing "no units available" because:
1. Properties existed but had no units
2. There was no way to create units
3. Tenants require units to exist

Now users can:
1. ‚úÖ Create properties
2. ‚úÖ Add units to properties (NEW!)
3. ‚úÖ Add tenants to units

The complete property management flow is operational! üéâ
