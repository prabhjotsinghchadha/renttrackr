 * Counter integration tests
 * 
 * NOTE: This file contains Playwright E2E tests that require a running server.
 * These tests should be run via Playwright E2E test suite, not Vitest integration tests.

 * The Counter API tests require:
 * - A running Next.js server
 * - HTTP request capabilities (page.request from Playwright)
 * 
 * To run these tests, use: npm run test:e2e
