Added two new tables:

#### Parking Permit Table

```typescript
parkingPermitSchema = {
  id: uuid (primary key)
  propertyId: uuid (references properties)
  tenantId: uuid (optional, references tenants)
  building: varchar(100) // e.g., "552 D"
  permitNumber: varchar(50) // required
  status: varchar(50) // Active, Cancelled, Suspended, Expired
  vehicleMake: varchar(100)
  vehicleModel: varchar(100)
  vehicleYear: varchar(10)
  vehicleColor: varchar(100)
  licensePlate: varchar(50)
  comments: varchar(2000)
  issuedAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

#### Parking Activity Table

```typescript
parkingActivitySchema = {
  id: uuid (primary key)
  parkingPermitId: uuid (references parking permits)
  note: varchar(1000) // for tracking changes and comments
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

### 2. **ParkingActions.ts** (`/src/actions/ParkingActions.ts`)
